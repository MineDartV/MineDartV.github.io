    <h1>I was able to create a pallette of colors from an image!</h1>
    <p>This was the image that inspired me to create this color pallette</p>
    <img src="Images/Outside colors.jpg" alt="My original image that inspired this">
    <p>I am using a complementary color scheme. The red primary color and the tertiary orange ish color are complementing the green as they are on opposite sides of the color wheel. I am trying to elicit the emotion of warmth within the person. Warmth is normally associated with reds and oranges, so I used those colors then I added a spark of green in order for it to stand out.
